Accept Open Banking payments in WooCommerce

Wallid enables merchants to accept account-to-account payments in WooCommerce using Open Banking. Customers pay directly from their bank account to the merchant’s bank account, without using debit or credit cards.

Once the Wallid payment method is enabled at checkout, payments are authorised within the customer’s own banking app and completed via the Faster Payments network.

Key features:
 * Instant settlement
Payments are transferred directly to the merchant’s bank account, typically in real time, without payout delays.
 * Transparent pricing
1% + 25p payment fees with discounts for high volume.
 * Secure bank authorisation
Customers authenticate payments using their bank’s existing security mechanisms. No card details are collected or stored.
 * WooCommerce-native integration
The plugin integrates directly with WooCommerce checkout and order management, requiring no custom development.
